# Sory's dotFiles

This is a list of the configuration files i use on a daily basis. 

## What is included?

* bash_profile
* vimrc
* vim folder with pluggins
* alacritty.yml
* tmux.conf
* enabler bash script to install the files.

## Important Notes:

* The enabler script makes use of relative paths, so for the script to work, you should source it or execute it from within the same directory as the script.
